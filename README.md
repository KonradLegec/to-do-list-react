# Task list v2.0

The following project is browser based web application used to prepare list of tasks to do. Each task can be easily marked as done or deleted using simple design buttons. Main idea of this project was to keep solutions as easy and understandable as possible. <br>
There are several improvements released with revision 1.0 and 1.1: 

1. Moved whole task list from vanilla.js to react.js
2. Implemented component based application idea.
3. Implemented deployment of build app version.

At the moment application does not have full funtionality yet, only user interface is migrated to React.js. Functionality and interactions will be there soon! Stay focused!!


## Technologies implemented:
1. HTML
2. CSS (Grid/Flex modules)
3. Java Script/React.js
4. BEM convention
5. Immutability convention

## How does it look?

The interface is kept in simple and clean design, there is basic background, simple and intuitive color convention and high readability.
